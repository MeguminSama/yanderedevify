# YandereDevify

A little tool that translates your good or not-so-good JavaScript (possibly other languages in future) code into much more unmaintainable and hard to understand mess, resembling style of famous indie game developer.

If you decide to look at the code don't get scared, it's purposefully written cancer.

#### Usage

Via `npx`:
```
npx yanderedevify /path/to/script.js > output.js
```

From a cloned repo:

```
npm install
node index.js /path/to/script.js > output.js
```
